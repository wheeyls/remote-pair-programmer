# CI Configuration

This directory contains configuration files and scripts for the continuous integration pipeline.

## Structure

- `workflows/`: GitHub Actions workflow definitions
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts used in the CI process
- `config/`: Configuration files for linting, testing, etc.

## Usage

These files will be installed in the CI pipeline. Do not modify them directly in this location.

## Notes

Originally these files were in the `.github` directory, but they have been moved here for easier maintenance.
